Reichman University Data Streaming Algorithms and Online Learning Final Project

## Summary
This project aims to expand on the paper
"Finding an Optimal Small Sample of Training Dataset for Computer Vision Deep-Learning Model"[[1]](#1)
by investigating the relationship between the dimension the dataset samples are reduced to via JLS
and the intrinsic dimension of the dataset as described by
"The intrinsic dimension of images and its impact on learning"[[2]](#2).
